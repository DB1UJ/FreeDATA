# FreeDATA
My attempt to create a free and opensource TNC with a GUI for [codec2](https://github.com/drowe67/codec2) to send data over HF channels. 

## Under development
This project is still a prototype and not usable at this time.
Build steps for other OS than Ubuntu are provided, but not working, yet.

## Credits
* David Rowe and the FreeDV team for developing the modem and libraries -
FreeDV Codec 2 : https://github.com/drowe67/codec2
* xssfox, her repository helped me a lot in an early stage of development -
xssfox : https://github.com/xssfox/freedv-tnc
* Wolfgang, for lending me his radio so I'm able to do real hf tests

## Running the Ubuntu app bundle
Just download the latest developer release from the releases section, unpack it and just start the ".AppImage file". No more dependencies
